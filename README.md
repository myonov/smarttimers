**Smart timers** is a project where you can configure nested sequences of
timers / stopwatches. It is ideal for tabata training, cooking or time 
measurements. 

* It is built with React and you can serve the static files from
the `build/` folder.

* It plays sounds before switching between different time tasks.

* It has mobile layout and your phone would not sleep during the time tasks.

* Timers would not be throttled if you switch the active tab.
